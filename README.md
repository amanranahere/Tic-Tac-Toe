# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Who hasn't played Tic-Tac-Toe? It's a classic game that everyone knows! I decided to create this fun version using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Players can enjoy the game while the board dynamically changes colors to indicate whose turn it is. The game checks for wins or draws and displays friendly messages, making it a great way to explore event handling, DOM manipulation, and game logic!

## Features

- Dynamic color changes to indicate player turns
